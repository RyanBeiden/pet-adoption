# Pet Adoption

This Repo displays using JavaScript and DOM to create HTML elements from a given array of Objects.

You will see how there are buttons to filter out the types of pets display on the screen. This was done through 
creating multiple pet functions that only run if the object in the array has a certain property in the "type" 
key. Then in the HTML document, when a button is clicked, a different function runs depending on the button.
